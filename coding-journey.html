            <h2>Early Life and Introduction to Coding</h2>
            <p>I was born on May 13, 1998, in Islampur, West Bengal, India. From a young age, I was captivated by technology, spending hours exploring computers. This early exposure ignited my curiosity about how software worked, leading me to teach myself programming languages.</p>
            <p>During my childhood, I discovered the basics of coding through online tutorials and coding platforms. I began with HTML and CSS, quickly grasping the concepts of web design. As I experimented with creating simple web pages, my interest grew, and I soon delved into JavaScript to add interactivity to my projects.</p>

            <h2>Skill Development and Projects</h2>
            <p>Over the years, I've honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by working on various personal projects. Some of my notable projects include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Portfolio Website:</strong> I developed a portfolio to showcase my coding projects and achievements, utilizing responsive design principles to ensure accessibility across devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Interactive Quiz App:</strong> I created a web application that tested usersâ€™ knowledge on various topics, using JavaScript to manage user interactions and display results dynamically.</li>
                <li><strong>Blog Platform:</strong> I built a simple blogging platform where users could create and manage posts, involving both front-end and back-end development, enhancing my understanding of web application architecture.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
            <p>After gaining confidence in my coding skills, I sought professional opportunities. I secured a role at Hiveloop Technology Pvt Ltd (Udaan.com) as an Executive, where I applied my coding knowledge to streamline hub operations and logistics processes. Utilizing Microsoft Office Suite and Google Workspace, I developed custom formula functions in Excel and Google Sheets using JavaScript. This allowed me to automate data calculations, improve efficiency in data management, and enhance reporting accuracy, making it easier for the team to analyze performance metrics and make informed decisions.</p>

            <p>Later, I joined Instakart Services Pvt Ltd (Flipkart) as a Team Leader (Off Role). In this position, I led a team and utilized my analytical skills to identify areas for improvement in logistics. I continued to harness my coding expertise to create advanced custom formulas and scripts that optimized workflows in Excel and Google Sheets. My efforts not only improved the speed and accuracy of data analysis but also contributed to effective resource allocation and performance tracking, further solidifying my passion for technology and problem-solving.</p>

            <h2>Community Involvement and Future Aspirations</h2>
            <p>I am an active member of the coding community. I frequently participate in local coding meetups and online forums, sharing knowledge and learning from others. I am also committed to mentoring young coders, encouraging them to explore the world of programming.</p>

            <p>Looking to the future, I aim to deepen my expertise in web development and explore frameworks like React and Node.js. I dream of creating more complex applications and potentially starting my own tech venture focused on innovative web solutions.</p>

            <h2>Personal Philosophy</h2>
            <p>I believe in the importance of continuous learning and experimentation. I regularly engage with online courses, coding challenges, and community projects to stay updated with industry trends. In my spare time, I enjoy reading tech blogs, watching tutorials, and exploring new technologies.</p>
